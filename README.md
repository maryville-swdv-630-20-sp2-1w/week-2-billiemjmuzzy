# Week 2 - Classes and Methods in Python

## Assignment Details

Build a CheckingAccount class and associated driver application. The class should contain appropriate attributes that you would find in a normal checking account: name, address, accounts number, balance, etc

The balance should be "private" to the class since it should only be changed through appropriate debit/credit methods. Recall, you can simulate the private aspect using the \_ character at the start of the variable name.

The class should be saved in a file called CheckingAccount.py

Build a driver application that instantiates a CheckingAccount object and performs a variety of debits and credits as well as prints the balance as appropriate.

## About Solution

### Files Included

- CheckingAccount.py: Class file
- driver.py: File to execute program
- data.json: driver.py reads from this file.

Note: If you are executing this program there are only two account numbers that it will except due to what is contained in data.json. The account numbers are `11111` and `22222`
